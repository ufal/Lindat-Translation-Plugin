		NameTag is an open-source tool for named entity recognition (NER). NameTag identifies proper names in text and classifies them into predefined categories, such as names of persons, locations, organizations, etc.
		<br/>
		NameTag 2 also recognizes nested named entities (nested NER) and as of 2019, it achieves state of the art in Czech, English, Dutch and Spanish and nearly state of the art in German (Strakov√° et al. 2019).
		<br/>
		NameTag is available as an online demo NameTag Online Demo and web service NameTag Web Service hosted by LINDAT/CLARIN.
